[[OVERVIEW]]
== OVERVIEW

Branch Prediction Unit is the unit responsible for predicting the branch
outcomes and branch targets before branch instructions are actually
resolved in the pipeline. This prediction allows the processor to prefetch and execute subsequent instructions without waiting to resolve the branch condition, minimizing stalls and maintaining high throughput in the pipeline.

It receives prediction input in the form of PC and instruction type from the
Fetch unit and predicts the direction and target address from which Fetch unit
has to get the next instruction.

[[Description_of_BasePredictor]]
== BasePredictor

[[Overview_of_the_BasePredictor]]
=== Overview
The BasePredictor consists of a Pattern History Table (PHT) indexed by a GShare hash
of PC and some specific number of global branch history bits, a Branch Target
Buffer (BTB), and a Return Address Stack (RAS).

[[Operation]]
=== Operation

image:media/bpu_process_flowchart.png[image,width=800, height=366]

* If the instruction type is a "call", the current PC is pushed to the
RAS, and is also sent to the BTB. If it is a hit, then the target is
sent out. Otherwise, an entry is made to the BTB.

** If the instruction type is a "ret", then the PC is simply popped from
the RAS, and the PC is sent out.

** If the instruction type is a branch then the PC is sent simultaneously
to the BTB, BasePredictor and the TAGE_SC_L-Predictor.
*** If it is a hit on BTB, and the BasePredictor predicts a taken
branch, then the output is sent to Fetch unit
*** If it is a hit on BTB, but
*** If it is not a hit on BTB, but the BasePredictor predicts a taken
branch, then an entry is allocated to the BTB.
** Pattern History Table (PHT) is indexed by the XOR hash of the last several
bits of global history and the PC.

[[Points_to_note]]
=== Points to note

** BTB only tells the target a branch can take if branch is taken, whether the
branch is actually (predicted to be) taken is a different question.

** Direction of branch is predicted by PHT and TAGE-SC-L

== TAGE

=== Overview
TAGE consists of a Bimodal table (a simple PC indexed n-bit counter table), backed by
a number of tagged predictor components which uses geometrically increasing history lengths.

Each entry in a tagged component consists of 3 fields -

    **  `pred` - represents the direction branch will take
    **  `useful`    - represents if the prediction made by same component turned out to be correct
        last time or not.
    **  `tag` - used for verifying that the entry corresponds to the current branch instruction.

Source: Andre Seznec, Pierre Michaud, A case for (partially) TAgged GEometric history length branch prediction

[[Operation_of_TAGE]]
=== Operation of TAGE

When prediction is requested, the Bi-Modal table (T0) and tagged components (Ti; 1 < i < M) are
accessed simultaneously. The Bi-modal table (base predictor) provides the default prediction.
Whereas the tagged components provide a prediction only on a tag match. The overall prediction is
provided by the hitting tagged predictor component that uses the longest history length. In case of
no matching tagged predictor component, the prediction given by default predictor is used. [1]

[[Description_of_Loop_Predictor]]
== Loop Predictor

A loop predictor can simply identify regular loops with constant number of
iterations. The loop predictor will provide the global prediction when it
identifies the branch as a loop with a constant iteration number and when this
identification has reached a high confidence, i.e. when the loop has been
executed several times with the same number of iterations.

It uses a Loop Predictor table which is essentially a k-way set associative table
whose entries are used to predict loops.

[[Fetch_Target_Queue]]
==  Fetch Target Queue

Fetch Target Queue stores information related to in-flight branches which are used to update
the BPU, once instructions are finally committed.

* Similar to ROB, but it is decoupled from it.

* Entries are allocated to FTQ when predictions are made.

* Upon retirement of the instruction, the corresponding FTQ entry is de-allocated
and `UpdateInput` containing `correctedDirection` and `correctedTargetPC` is sent to BPU to
update BPU's internal state.

=== FTQ enable multi-level branch predictor hierarchy
The FTQ stores predicted addresses from the branch predictor, later to be consumed by the
instruction cache.

Entries stored in the FTQ can be consumed by the instruction cache while the branch predictor
accesses higher levels of its hierarchy. [3]

=== Overriding mechanism
* BasePredictor makes the prediction for every incoming branch instruction it receives and pushes
the prediction to FTQ as soon it is made.

* This prediction stored in FTQ is utilized to fetch next instruction from instruction cache
while the branch predictor accesses higher level(TAGE-SC-L) of its hierarchy.

* Once the prediction by TAGE-SC-L is made, it is compared against the prediction made by
BasePredictor, which is already stored in FTQ.

* In case the prediction made by TAGE-SC-L mismatches the prediction made by BasePredictor,
then instructions are flushed and newly created prediction is inserted to FTQ.

* Otherwise, instruction execution continues as it is.

* Port 1 -> `in_bpu_first_prediction_` - Receives prediction made by BasePredictor of BPU
* Port 2 -> `in_bpu_second_prediction_` - Receives prediction made by TAGE-SC-L of BPU
* Port 3 -> `out_ftq_prediction_` - Send PredictionOutput to FTQ
* Port 4 -> `out_bpu_update_` - Send UpdateInput to BPU to carry out any BPU state update
* Port 5 -> `in_rob_signal_` - Receives signal from ROB during commit
* Port 6 -> `TODO` - to enable flushing instructions in case of mismatch between first level and second
level prediction.

[[Test_Bench_Description]]
== Test Bench Descriptions

[[Description_of_Test_1]]
=== 1. Basic branch prediction accuracy test

Verifies that the BPU correctly predicts simple highly biased branches

[[Description_of_Test_2]]
=== 2. Branch prediction warm up test

On start-up, BPU takes several iterations to start predicting correctly. This test verifies
that on reset BPU is initialized properly.

[[Description_of_Test_3]]
===  3. Branch mis-prediction recovery test

On mis-prediction, test that BPU is updated and pipeline are flushed properly.

[[Description_of_Test_4]]
===  4. Dynamic branch prediction test

Tests that BPU properly predicts a mix of simple and complex branches.
