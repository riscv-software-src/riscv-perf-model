## Introduction

Olympia can take input in two formats: JSON and
[STF](https://github.com/sparcians/stf_spec).

JSON files are usually reserved for doing *very* small and quick
"what-if" analysis or general testing.  JSON format should not be used
to represent an entire program.

STF format is the preferred format to represent a workload to run on
Olympia.  STFs are typically created by a RISC-V functional model that
has been instrumented to generate one.

Two functional models which generate STFs are documented.
[Spike-STF](https://github.com/condorcomputing/condor.riscv-isa-sim)
 is the latest model, 
[Dromajo](https://github.com/chipsalliance/dromajo) also generates
STFs. 

Spike-STF ISA suport is more recent. Spike-STF adds other features such as BBV generation. 

Documentation for trace generation is provided for both functional models.

## JSON Inputs

JSON inputs are typically generated by hand.  There are no automated
tools in this repository (or in
[Sparcians](https://github.com/sparcians)) that will create these
files.

The grammar for the JSON file is simple.  Keep in mind that JSON does
not support comments.

Top level:

```
[
   {
      ... instruction record 1
   },
   ....
   {
      ... instruction record N
   }
]
```
Instruction record can have:
```
    {
        "mnemonic" : "<risc-v mnemonic>",

        ... for integer
        "rs1"      :  <numeric value, decimal>,
        "rs2"      :  <numeric value, decimal>,
        "rd"       :  <numeric value, decimal>,

        ... for float
        "fs1"      :  <numeric value, decimal>,
        "fs2"      :  <numeric value, decimal>,
        "fd"       :  <numeric value, decimal>,

        ... for immediates
        "imm"      :  <numeric value, decimal>,

        ... for branches, loads, stores
        "vaddr"    :  "<string value>",
    }
```

Example:
```
[
    {
        "mnemonic": "add",
        "rs1": 1,
        "rs2": 2,
        "rd": 3
    },
    {
        "mnemonic": "mul",
        "rs1": 3,
        "rs2": 1,
        "rd": 4
    },
    {
        "mnemonic": "lw",
        "rs1": 4,
        "rd": 3,
        "imm":  128,
        "vaddr" : "0xdeadbeef"
    }

]
```

To run the JSON file, just provide it to olympia:
```
cd build
./olympia ../traces/example_json.json`
```

## STF Inputs

Using the [stf_lib](https://github.com/sparcians/stf_lib) in the [Sparcians](https://github.com/sparcians)
repo, Olympia is capable of reading a RISC-V STF trace generated from
a functional simulator.  Included in Olympia (in this directory) are several trace files

```
  - traces/dhrystone_opt1.zstf  1000 iterations of a baremetal Dhrystone 
                                run with optimization set for 'Ground Rules'.
  - traces/dhrystone_opt2.zstf  1000 iterations of a baremetal Dhrystone 
                                run with optimization allowing in-lining.
  - traces/dhrystone_opt3.zstf  1000 iterations of baremetal Dhrystone 
                                run with optimization allowing in-lining
                                and LT. Baremetal

  - traces/core_riscv.zstf      Hot spot of Coremark generated by Dromajo
  - traces/dhrystone.zstf       Hot spot of Dhrystone generated by Dromajo
  - traces/core_riscv.zstf      Hot spot of Coremark generated by Dromajo
```

To run an STF file, provide the path to olympia:
```
cd build
./olympia ../traces/dhrystone_opt1.zstf
./olympia ../traces/dhrystone_opt2.zstf
./olympia ../traces/dhrystone_opt3.zstf
./olympia ../traces/dhrystone.zstf
./olympia ../traces/core_riscv.zstf
```

## Instrumenting Source for Tracing

There are multiple ways to trigger tracing. The macro tracing scheme
instruments source code with trace boundary macros. These
macros are nops with known operand encodings comprehended by
the functional models. The macro tracing scheme supports baremetal and 
linux application tracing.

The source code is instrumented by insertion of `START_TRACE` and `STOP_TRACE`.

For example:
``` main() {
    // ... init code

    START_TRACE;
    // Dhrystone benchmark code
    STOP_TRACE;

    // ... teardown
   }

```
The `START_TRACE` and `STOP_TRACE` macros are defined in `traces/stf_trace_gen/trace_macros.h`.

Instructions between the macros will be recorded in the trace output.

Spike-STF supports other tracing modes. Both Dromajo and Spike-STF support 
the macro tracing mode.

---------------------------------------------------------
## Generating Baremetal Traces

### Build Spike-STF
The first step to generating an STF with Spike-STF is to clone and build
the Spike-STF [repo](https://github.com/condorcomputing/condor.riscv-isa-sim).

This example uses the `riscv-perf-model/traces` directory as a working
directory.

The steps are: clone the repo, download and add the baremetal compiler to your
path, and build/regress/install Spike-STF.

The compiler steps are optional if you have `riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc` in 
your path.

```bash
cd riscv-perf-model/traces
git clone https://github.com/condorcomputing/condor.riscv-isa-sim.git --recurse-submodules

cd condor.riscv-isa-sim
bash scripts/download-bm-compiler.sh
export PATH=`pwd`/riscv-embecosm-embedded-ubuntu2204-20250309/bin:$PATH
which riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc       #verify compiler is in your path
```
Exit the conda environment, if enabled, before compiling Spike-STF.
```
conda deactivate
conda deactivate

mkdir -p build install && cd build
../configure --prefix=`pwd`/../install
make -j$(nproc)
make regress
make install
```

The regress target executes the [riscv-tests](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-tests) test suite. Pass/fail is reported.

The compiler is a prebuilt RISC-V cross compiler from [Embecosm](https://embecosm.com/).

There is detailed information in the Spike-STF repo, 
[README_FORK.mk](https://github.com/condorcomputing/condor.riscv-isa-sim/blob/spike_stf/README_FORK.md)  and [USAGE.md](https://github.com/condorcomputing/condor.riscv-isa-sim/blob/spike_stf/USAGE.md).

### Generating the Baremetal Dhrystone Traces

When Spike-STF is initially configured the dhrystone ELFs are created. If they need to be re-created:

```bash
cd riscv-perf-model/traces/condor.riscv-isa-sim
make -C dhrystone
```

This creates 3 versions of the dhrystone elf with 3 different levels of 
optimization running 1000 iterations. The source code has been modified to
add the trace macros and to allow simplified execution under baremetal with
limited syscall support.

A discussion of the 3 optimization levels is available in [USAGE.md](https://github.com/condorcomputing/condor.riscv-isa-sim/blob/spike_stf/USAGE.md#dhrystone-optimization-discussion).

Once the ELFs are built, traces are generated by:

```
cd riscv-perf-model/traces/condor.riscv-isa-sim

bash scripts/run-spike-stf.sh dhrystone/bin/dhrystone_opt1.1000.gcc.bare.riscv \
                              dhrystone_opt1.zstf
bash scripts/run-spike-stf.sh dhrystone/bin/dhrystone_opt2.1000.gcc.bare.riscv \
                              dhrystone_opt2.zstf
bash scripts/run-spike-stf.sh dhrystone/bin/dhrystone_opt3.1000.gcc.bare.riscv \
                              dhrystone_opt3.zstf
```

The compressed trace outputs can then be run on olympia by

```
<cd to the directory containing olympia>

./olympia ../traces/condor.riscv-isa-sim/trace_out/dhrystone_opt1.zstf
./olympia ../traces/condor.riscv-isa-sim/trace_out/dhrystone_opt2.zstf
./olympia ../traces/condor.riscv-isa-sim/trace_out/dhrystone_opt3.zstf
```
## Generating Linux Traces

### Building the Linux Dhrystone Elfs

In order to compile applications for linux, you must have riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc in your path.

```
cd riscv-perf-model/traces/condor.riscv-isa-sim
bash scripts/download-lnx-compiler.sh
export PATH=`pwd`/riscv64-embecosm-linux-gcc-ubuntu2204-20240407/bin:$PATH
```

To build the linux version of the Dhrystone benchmarks:
```
cd riscv-perf-model/traces/condor.riscv-isa-sim
make -C dhrystone bin-linux
```

Directory dhrystone/bin will contain:
```
dhrystone/bin/dhrystone_opt1.1000.gcc.linux.riscv
dhrystone/bin/dhrystone_opt2.1000.gcc.linux.riscv
dhrystone/bin/dhrystone_opt3.1000.gcc.linux.riscv
```

### Building the Linux Collateral

In order to generate linux based traces a linux environment is required as well as a linux cross compiler in your path. See above for the compiler.

A linux environment consists of a bootloader, the linux kernel and a 
root file system.

The process to clone and build these components is contained in a script.
This is a lengthy process.

```bash
cd riscv-perf-model/traces/condor.riscv-isa-sim
bash scripts/build-linux-collateral.sh
```

Once complete, the directory `riscv-perf-model/traces/condor.riscv-isa-sim/riscv-linux` will contain the files necessary to boot linux.
```
fw_jump.elf
rootfs.cpio
Image
```

### Booting Linux on Spike-STF
With the linux components built, boot linux using the helper script:
```
cd riscv-perf-model/traces/condor.riscv-isa-sim
bash scripts/boot-linux.sh
```
The credentials are root/root.

Hitting control-c a few times will exit the simulator. Depending on what is
running under linux it is sometimes necessary to kill the spike PID.

### Updating the Root File System
To trace applications under linux it is necessary to add them to the root
file system. This makes them available from the spike/linux console.

In this example the 3 versions of dhrystone linux are built into the root
file system.

This script builds the `dhrystone_optN.1000.gcc.linux.riscv` elfs, adds them to
the buildroot source tree, rebuilds rootfs, and copies the image to riscv-linux
for use in the next section.

```
cd riscv-perf-model/traces/condor.riscv-isa-sim
bash scripts/build-trace-rootfs.sh
```

This script performs basic checking, and copies the dhrystone linux ELFS to 
a location in the buildroot tree.

```
${BUILDROOT}/output/target/root/trace_elfs
```

This location ensures access to the elfs once the root file system has been recompiled and linux has been booted.

### Invoke Linux and Generate the Traces


Once the new rootfs is built we boot linux on spike with tracing enabled from the
command line. We use the boot-linux.sh script with two additional
arguments. The first specifes the new rootfs and the second specifies the path
for the STF trace output.

```
cd riscv-perf-model/traces/condor.riscv-isa-sim
bash scripts/boot-linux.sh --rootfs ./riscv-linux/trace_rootfs.cpio \
                           --trace ./trace_out/linux_trace.zstf
```
Once linux boots, enter the root/root credentials, then from the ash shell
cd to `trace_elfs and run the dhrystone_opt3.1000.gcc.bare.riscv.zstf

### Sample Session

A sample session: 

```
Welcome to Buildroot
buildroot login: root
root
Password: root

# cd trace_elfs
cd trace_elfs
# ls
ls
dhrystone_opt1.1000.gcc.linux.riscv  dhrystone_opt3.1000.gcc.linux.riscv
dhrystone_opt2.1000.gcc.linux.riscv
# ./dhrystone_opt3.1000.gcc.linux.riscv

...snip...
-I: traced 241546 instructions
...snip...
Str_2_Loc:           DHRYSTONE PROGRAM, 2'ND STRING
        should be:   DHRYSTONE PROGRAM, 2'ND STRING

Measured time too small to obtain meaningful results
Please increase number of runs

# <control-c>
# ^C(spike) quit
```

Once you have exited spike and are returned to the main o/s, the trace_out
directory will hold the trace file.
```
-rw-r--r-- 1 random agroup 12097 Jan 1 00:00 linux_trace.zstf
```

Note _any_ trace-enabled ELF you run while in spike linux will be added to the
same trace file.

This is useful in cases.

For other use cases, check the USAGE.md file in the Spike-STF repo for
instructions on how to use initd to automate linux based trace generation.

See [Automating Linux Tracing with INIT.d](https://github.com/condorcomputing/condor.riscv-isa-sim/blob/spike_stf/USAGE.md#automating-linux-tracing-with-initd)


-----------------------------------------------------
### Generating an STF Trace with Dromajo

#### Build an STF-Capable Dromajo

Included with olympia is a patch to Dromajo to enable it to generate
an STF trace.  This patch must be applied to Dromajo before a trace
can be generated.

```
# Enter into the STF trace generation directory (not required)
cd olympia/traces/stf_trace_gen

# Clone Dromajo from Chips Alliance and cd into it
git clone https://github.com/chipsalliance/dromajo

# Checkout a Known-to-work SHA
cd dromajo
git checkout f3c3112

# Apply the patch
git apply ../dromajo_stf_lib.patch

# Create a sym link to the stf_lib used by Olympia
ln -s ../../../stf_lib

# Build Dromajo
mkdir build; cd build
cmake ..
make
```
If compilation was successful, dromajo will have support for generating an STF trace:
```
./dromajo
usage: ./dromajo {options} [config|elf-file]
       .... other stuff
       --stf_trace <filename>  Dump an STF trace to the given file
       .... more stuff
```

#### Instrument a Workload for Tracing

Dromajo can run either a [baremetal application](https://github.com/chipsalliance/dromajo/blob/master/doc/setup.md#small-baremetal-program) or
a full application using Linux.

For this example, since Dromajo does not support system call
emulation, the workload dhrystone is instrumented and run inside
Linux.

The Dhrystone included with Olympia (`dhry_1.c`) is instrumented with
two extra lines of code to start/stop tracing.

``` main() {
    // ... init code

    START_TRACE;
    // Dhrystone benchmark code
    STOP_TRACE;

    // ... teardown
   }

```
The `START_TRACE` and `STOP_TRACE` macros are defined in `traces/stf_trace_gen/trace_macros.h`.

[Follow the directions](https://github.com/chipsalliance/dromajo/blob/master/doc/setup.md#linux-with-buildroot)
on booting Linux with a buildroot on Dromajo's page.

Build `dhrystone` that's included with olympia.  Set `RISCV_TOOLSUITE`
to a local copy of a RISC-V gcc location.

```
% cd dromajo/run
% $RISCV_TOOLSUITE/bin/riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O3 -DTIME ../../dhrystone/*.c -o dhry_riscv.elf
```
Copy `dhry_riscv.elf` into the buildroot and rebuild the root file system:
```
% cp dhry_riscv.elf ./buildroot-2020.05.1/output/target/sbin/
% make -C buildroot-2020.05.1
% cp buildroot-2020.05.1/output/images/rootfs.cpio .
```

To build `coremark` (not included with olympia), clone RISC-V ported `coremark` from
the below url. Set `RISCV_TOOLSUITE` to a local copy of a RISC-V toolchain location.
```
# Clone Coremark from EEMBC and cd into it
% git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/riscv-boom/riscv-coremark.git
% cd riscv-coremark/coremark

# Build coremark
% make RISCVTOOLS=$RISCV_TOOLSUITE PORT_DIR=../riscv64/ compile
```

Copy the generated `coremark.riscv` into the buildroot and rebuild the root file system:
```
% cp coremark.riscv ./buildroot-2020.05.1/output/target/sbin/
% make -C buildroot-2020.05.1
% cp buildroot-2020.05.1/output/images/rootfs.cpio .
```

Run Dromajo with the flag `--stf_trace`, log in, and run the benchmark for
1000 iterations (as an example):

```
% ../build/dromajo --stf_trace dhry_riscv.zstf boot.cfg

OpenSBI v0.8
