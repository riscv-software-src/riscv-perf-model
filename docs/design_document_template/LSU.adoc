== OVERVIEW

The Load Store Unit (LSU) implements the memory interface for the Olympia processor. Managing all load and store operations. The LSU features multiple parallel pipelines, data forwarding capabilities, and ensures memory consistency while maintaining high performance through careful hazard management and efficient queueing structures.

== Functional Description

=== Unit Block Description

The LSU consists of several key functional blocks:

1. *Instruction Queues*
   - Load/Store Instruction Queue (ldst_inst_queue_)
   - Store Buffer (store_buffer_)
   - Ready Queue (ready_queue_)

2. *Pipeline Units*
   - Multiple parallel Load/Store pipelines
   - Address Generation Units
   - Data Forwarding Logic

3. *Interface Controllers*
   - MMU Interface
   - Cache Interface
   - ROB Interface

=== Key Components Detail

==== Load/Store Instruction Queue (ldst_inst_queue_)
* Size: Configurable through ldst_inst_queue_size_ parameter
* Purpose: Holds instructions from dispatch until ready for execution
* Implementation: sparta::Buffer template with LoadStoreInstInfoPtr
* Key Methods:
[source,cpp]
----
void allocateInstToIssueQueue_(const InstPtr & inst_ptr)
void popIssueQueue_(const LoadStoreInstInfoPtr & inst_ptr)
----

==== Store Buffer
* Size: Matches ldst_inst_queue_size_
* Purpose:
  - Maintains program order for stores
  - Enables store-to-load forwarding
  - Tracks uncommitted stores
* Implementation:
[source,cpp]
----
sparta::Buffer<LoadStoreInstInfoPtr> store_buffer_;
LoadStoreInstInfoPtr findYoungestMatchingStore_(const uint64_t addr) const;
----

==== Pipeline Stages

[width="100%",cols="20%,15%,65%",options="header",]
|===
|Stage |Cycles |Function
|Address Calculation |1 |Virtual address generation
|MMU Lookup |1-N |Address translation
|Cache Lookup |1-N |Cache access initiation
|Cache Read |1 |Data retrieval
|Complete |1 |Instruction completion
|===

=== Operation Flow

1. *Instruction Receipt*
   - Receives instructions from dispatch
   - Allocates queue entries
   - Begins tracking dependencies

2. *Issue Stage*
   - Checks operand readiness
   - Verifies no hazards exist
   - Selects ready instructions for execution

3. *Execution*
   - Address calculation
   - MMU interaction
   - Cache access
   - Data forwarding when applicable

4. *Completion*
   - Updates architectural state
   - Handles exceptions
   - Signals ROB for retirement

=== Data Forwarding Implementation

The data forwarding logic is implemented through the store buffer and involves:

1. *Store Buffer Search*
   [source,cpp]
   ----
   LoadStoreInstInfoPtr findYoungestMatchingStore_(const uint64_t addr) const {
       auto it = std::find_if(store_buffer_.rbegin(), store_buffer_.rend(),
                             [addr](const auto& store) {
                                 return store->getInstPtr()->getTargetVAddr() == addr;
                             });
       return (it != store_buffer_.rend()) ? *it : nullptr;
   }
   ----
   This initial search method identifies the youngest store that matches a specific address. However, for comprehensive forwarding, especially when a load might be covered by multiple stores or a store might partially cover a load, a more detailed check is required.

2. *Forward Detection*
   [source,cpp]
   ----
   void handleCacheLookupReq_() {
       // ...
       if (!inst_ptr->isStoreInst() && allow_data_forwarding_) {
           const uint64_t load_addr = inst_ptr->getTargetVAddr();
             // The original findYoungestMatchingStore_ might be a quick initial check
           // auto forwarding_store = findYoungestMatchingStore_(load_addr);
             // A more comprehensive check like tryStoreToLoadForwarding is needed for full/partial coverage:
           if (tryStoreToLoadForwarding(inst_ptr, mem_access_info_ptr)) { // <1>
               mem_access_info_ptr->setDataReady(true);
               mem_access_info_ptr->setCacheState(MemoryAccessInfo::CacheState::HIT);
               return;
           }
       }
       // ...
   }
   ----
   <1> `tryStoreToLoadForwarding` is a more detailed function to check full data coverage.

[[Comprehensive_Forwarding_Check]]
==== Comprehensive Forwarding Check (tryStoreToLoadForwarding)

To determine if a load instruction can receive all its data from the `store_buffer_`, a more thorough check is performed. This mechanism is crucial for performance, as it can prevent stalls by bypassing cache access if data is available more locally.

The process involves the following steps:

1.  *Initialization*:
    * The load's target virtual address (`load_addr`) and its size (`load_size`) are obtained.
    * A `coverage_mask` (typically a `std::vector<bool>` or a bitmask like `uint64_t` for smaller loads) is created with a size equal to `load_size`. Each element/bit corresponds to a byte of the load, initialized to indicate "not covered."
    * A counter, `bytes_covered_count`, is initialized to zero.

2.  *Store Buffer Iteration*:
    * The `store_buffer_` is iterated from the youngest (most recently added) store to the oldest. This order is critical to ensure that if multiple stores write to the same byte, the data from the youngest store is considered for forwarding.
    * For each store in the buffer:
        * The store's virtual address (`store_addr`) and size (`store_size`) are retrieved.
        * The overlapping memory region between the current load and the store is calculated:
            * `overlap_start_addr = std::max(load_addr, store_addr)`
            * `overlap_end_addr = std::min(load_addr + load_size, store_addr + store_size)`
        * If `overlap_start_addr < overlap_end_addr`, an actual overlap exists.

3.  *Updating Coverage*:
    * For each byte within the calculated overlapping region:
        * The byte's 0-based index relative to the `load_addr` (`load_byte_idx`) is determined.
        * If the `coverage_mask` indicates that this `load_byte_idx` has *not* yet been covered by an even younger store (i.e., `!coverage_mask[load_byte_idx]`):
            * The `coverage_mask` for `load_byte_idx` is marked as "covered" (e.g., set to `true`).
            * `bytes_covered_count` is incremented.
    * This ensures each byte of the load is counted only once towards being covered, and by the youngest store that provides it.

4.  *Early Exit Optimization*:
    * If, after processing any store, `bytes_covered_count` becomes equal to `load_size`, it means all bytes of the load are covered. The iteration through the `store_buffer_` can stop early, as no further stores need to be checked.

5.  *Final Determination*:
    * After iterating through the necessary stores, if `bytes_covered_count == load_size`, the load can be fully forwarded.
    * In this case, the load's `MemoryAccessInfoPtr` is updated: `setDataReady(true)` and `setCacheState(MemoryAccessInfo::CacheState::HIT)`. The LSU can then proceed as if the data was instantaneously available, bypassing a full cache lookup for the data itself.
    * If `bytes_covered_count < load_size`, the load cannot be fully forwarded from the store buffer and must proceed to the cache for the remaining (or all) data.

This comprehensive check allows the LSU to forward data even if it's sourced from multiple (potentially partial) stores, significantly improving performance for common RAW (Read-After-Write) hazard scenarios.

=== Multi-Pipeline Design

The LSU implements multiple parallel pipelines through:

1. *Pipeline Configuration*
[source,cpp]
----
PARAMETER(uint32_t, num_pipelines, 2, "Number of load/store pipelines")
std::vector<LoadStorePipeline> ldst_pipelines_;
----

2. *Pipeline Management*
- Round-robin allocation
- Independent progress tracking
- Shared resource arbitration
