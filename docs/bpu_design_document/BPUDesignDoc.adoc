[[OVERVIEW]]
== OVERVIEW

Branch Prediction Unit is the unit responsible for predicting the branch outcomes and branch targets before branch
instructions are actually resolved in the pipeline. This prediction allows the processor to prefetch and execute
subsequent instructions without waiting to resolve the branch condition, minimizing stalls and maintaining high
throughput in the pipeline.

The proposed design receives input in the form of `PredictionRequest` from the Fetch unit and predicts in the form
of `PredictionRequest` (includes direction and target address) from which Fetch unit fetches the next instruction.
Information to update the internal state of BPU is received in the form of `UpdateInput` when the instructions are
committed.

Olympia's Branch Prediction API expects the implementation of Branch Predictor to specify its implementation of a
prediction input, prediction output, and the update input.

=== Overview

of PC and some specific number of global branch history bits, a Branch Target
Buffer (BTB), and a Return Address Stack (RAS).

[[Operation]]
=== Operation

image:media/bpu_process_flowchart.png[image,width=800, height=366]

* If the instruction type is a "call", the current PC is pushed to the
RAS, and is also sent to the BTB. If it is a hit, then the target is
sent out. Otherwise, an entry is made to the BTB.

** If the instruction type is a "ret", then the PC is simply popped from
the RAS, and the PC is sent out.

** If the instruction type is a branch then the PC is sent simultaneously
to the BTB, BasePredictor and the TAGE_SC_L-Predictor.
*** If it is a hit on BTB, and the BasePredictor predicts a taken
branch, then the output is sent to Fetch unit
*** If it is a hit on BTB, but
*** If it is not a hit on BTB, but the BasePredictor predicts a taken
branch, then an entry is allocated to the BTB.
** Pattern History Table (PHT) is indexed by the XOR hash of the last several
bits of global history and the PC.

[[Points_to_note]]
=== Points to note

** BTB only tells the target a branch can take if branch is taken, whether the
branch is actually (predicted to be) taken is a different question.

** Direction of branch is predicted by PHT and TAGE-SC-L

[[Description_of_TAGE]]
== TAGE

=== Overview
TAGE consists of a Bimodal table (a simple PC indexed n-bit counter table), backed by
a number of tagged predictor components which uses geometrically increasing history lengths.

Each entry in a tagged component consists of 3 fields -

    **  `ctr` - represents the direction branch will take
    **  `useful`    - represents if the prediction made by same component turned out to be correct
        last time or not.
    **  `tag` - used for verifying that the entry corresponds to the current branch instruction.

Source: Andre Seznec, Pierre Michaud, A case for (partially) TAgged GEometric history length branch prediction

[[Operation_of_TAGE]]
=== Operation of TAGE

==== How is prediction made?

* When prediction is requested, the Bi-Modal table (T0) is accessed using PC and the tagged components
(Ti; 1 < i < M) are accessed using a hash of PC and geometrically increasing numbers of branch history bits.

* The Bi-modal table (base predictor) provides the default prediction.

* Whereas the tagged components provide a prediction only on a tag match.

* The overall prediction is provided by the hitting tagged predictor component that uses the longest history length.
In case of no matching tagged predictor component, the prediction given by default predictor is used. [1]

==== Internal state update

* Global resetting of useful component - After a certain number of branch instructions, useful bits of all the entries
are reset.

* When prediction is correct

** The counter bits of provider component is updated appropriately.

** The useful bits of provider component is incremented whenever prediction is correct and altpred is incorrect (TODO :
verify condition).

** No new entry is allocated anywhere.

* When prediction is incorrect

** The counter bits of provider component is updated appropriately.

** As a second step, if the provider component (Ti) is not the component using the longest history (i.e i < M), we try
to allocate a new entries to components (Tk) using a longest history (i.e i < k < M).

*** TODO : Deciding the number of newer entries to allocate on mis-prediction.

*** In order to allocate newer entries, useful bits are read and the component whose useful bits are null is chosen.

== Statistical Corrector

**Input** - Prediction + (Address, History) pair

**To decide** - whether to invert the prediction or not?

Since in most cases the prediction provided by the TAGE predictor is correct,
the Statistical Corrector predictor agrees most of the time with the
TAGE predictor, therefore a relatively small Statistical Corrector
predictor performs close to an unlimited size Statistical Corrector
predictor [2].

[[Description_of_Loop_Predictor]]
== Loop Predictor

A loop predictor can simply identify regular loops with constant number of
iterations. The loop predictor will provide the global prediction when it
identifies the branch as a loop with a constant iteration number and when this
identification has reached a high confidence, i.e. when the loop has been
executed several times with the same number of iterations.

It uses a Loop Predictor table which is essentially a k-way set associative table
whose entries are used to predict loops.

[[Fetch_Target_Queue]]
==  Fetch Target Queue

Fetch Target Queue stores information related to in-flight branches which are used to update
the BPU, once instructions are finally committed.

* Similar to ROB, but it is decoupled from it.

* Entries are allocated to FTQ when predictions are made.

* Upon retirement of the instruction, the corresponding FTQ entry is de-allocated
and `UpdateInput` containing `correctedDirection` and `correctedTargetPC` is sent to BPU to
update BPU's internal state.

=== FTQ enable multi-level branch predictor hierarchy
The FTQ stores predicted addresses from the branch predictor, later to be consumed by the
instruction cache.

Entries stored in the FTQ can be consumed by the instruction cache while the branch predictor
accesses higher levels of its hierarchy. [3]

=== Overriding mechanism
* BasePredictor makes the prediction for every incoming branch instruction it receives and pushes
the prediction to FTQ as soon it is made.

* This prediction stored in FTQ is utilized to fetch next instruction from instruction cache
while the branch predictor accesses higher level(TAGE-SC-L) of its hierarchy.

* Once the prediction by TAGE-SC-L is made, it is compared against the prediction made by
BasePredictor, which is already stored in FTQ.

* In case the prediction made by TAGE-SC-L mismatches the prediction made by BasePredictor,
then instructions are flushed and newly created prediction is inserted to FTQ.

* Otherwise, instruction execution continues as it is.

level prediction.
* Port 4 -> `out_fetch_prediction_` - Send PredictionOutput to Fetch/ICache
* Port 5 -> `in_rob_signal_` - Receives signal from ROB during commit

[[Interaction_between_BPU_and_FTQ]]
=== Interaction between BPU and FTQ
* First level prediction can only be pushed to FTQ if there is space available.
* Second level prediction is sent to FTQ through `sparta::DataOutPort` without any such constraint,
since second level prediction only verifies (or replaces, in case mis-prediction) the prediction already
stored in the FTQ.
* Credits are transferred from FTQ to BPU to keep track of available FTQ capacity.
        ** Credits are sent to BPU everytime FTQEntry is de-allocated from FTQ at commit.

[[Interaction_between_FTQ_and_Fetch_or_ICache]]
