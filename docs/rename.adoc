[[OVERVIEW]]
== OVERVIEW

The Rename block of Olympia enables a simple OoO architectural to
physical mapping design for CPU micro-architectural analysis.  The
principles are simple: rename architectural registers to an
available/popped physical register.  For example:

[source,asm]
----
# Before renaming
add x3, x4, x5

# After renaming
add p41, p53, p62

[[Functional_Description]]
== Functional Description

The class `Rename` is the main `sparta::Unit` that handles all
renaming functionality in Olympia.

Instructions enter Rename via the `sparta::DataInPort` called
`in_uop_queue_append_` inside a container class called `InstGroup`.
The number of instructions in this container is controlled via a
rename parameter called `num_to_rename`.

When the `InstGroup` is presented to Rename, Rename will attempt
renaming _in order_ via one of two ways controlled by the parameter
`partial_rename`:

1. `partial_rename == true`: Rename will rename instructions in the
   given `InstGroup` until one of the following conditions apply:
  - Rename has run out of PRFs for the next instruction
  - Rename has run of out downstream credits to send instructions (`credits_dispatch_`)
1. `partial_rename == false`: For the given `InstGroup`, Rename will
   *not* rename any of the instructions until:
  - Rename ensures there are enough PRFs to rename *all* of the instructions in the group
  - Rename ensures there are enough downstream credits to send *all*
    of the instructions in the group (`credits_dispatch_`)

[[Operation]]
=== Operation

==== Accepting Instructions

Before simulation begins, Rename will send upstream (typically to
Decode) the maximum number of instructions Rename can receive in
total.  This is not the _bandwidth_ between the upstream unit and
Rename, just the total number of instructions Rename can potentially
buffer.  In Olympia, this value is determined by the parameter
`num_to_rename` which is modeled to be the same as the bandwidth.

Phrased differently, if the parameter `num_to_rename` is 4 and Rename
is currently not renaming any instructions, Rename can receive up to 4
instructions.  If Rename has 2 instructions it cannot rename from the
previous cycle, the Rename can only accept 2.

==== Processing Arriving Instructions

When instructions arrive on port `in_uop_queue_append_` via the
container `InstGroup`, Rename will move those instructions to an
internal UOP queue (`uop_queue_`) for convenience and maintenance.
Rename will then schedule internal `sparta::Unique` event
`ev_schedule_rename_` for the same cycle to _possibly_ schedule a
renaming event for the newly arrived instructions.

==== Scheduling Renaming

The callback `Rename::scheduleRenaming_` (registered by the event
`ev_schedule_rename_`) will eventually be called by the Sparta
scheduler. This method will determine if Renaming can occur by:

- Examining the parameter `partial_rename` and determining if there
  are enough resources to rename instructions
- Examining downstream credits to ensure the downstream unit can
  accept instructions being renamed
- Examining the `uop_queue_` for any instructions

If all conditions have been met, the event `ev_rename_insts_` will be
scheduled for *this* cycle.

Instructions coming from upstream, credits arriving from downstream,
and resources being returned from retiring instructions will schedule
a renaming session.

==== Renaming Instructions

Renaming instructions (`Rename::renameInstructions_` scheduled by the
event `ev_rename_insts_`) only happens if the scheduling event
(previous section) determines there are enough resources to do so.

NOTE: Renaming instructions _should only occur_ if the previous step has
been satisfied.  There are asserts in the code to ensure this flow is
maintained.

Renaming works by retrieving the instructions from the `uop_queue_`
_in order_ and renaming the sources of that instruction followed by
the destinations. The *order* of renaming is important: an
instruction's sources must be renamed _first_ before the instruction's
destinations.  If this order is not followed and an instruction's
destination is the same as any of it's sources the machine will
deadlock.

===== Renaming Sources

Rename maintains a map of current PRFs that hold the latest values for a
given ARF (`map_table_`). During source renaming, the instruction's
ARF sources are "replaced" by the current PRF sources being written by
older instructions.  The instruction updates its current
`src_reg_bit_masks_` to reflect that PRF.  This bit mask is used by
downstream units such as Issue to compare against a "global"
scoreboard of ready PRFs.  If the Instruction's mask `and` 'ed with
the Scoreboard's `global_reg_ready_mask_` returns the instruction's
full mask then all of the instruction's sources are ready and the
instruction can be executed.

===== Renaming Destinations

If an instruction has a destination, that instruction will need to
write its final value to a PRF.  To do this, Rename will need to
replace the instruction's destination ARF with an assigned PRF.

Free or unused PRFs are maintained by Rename in a freelist contained
in a structure called `RegFileComponents`.  There is 1
`RegFileComponents` instance _per regfile_ (Integer, Float, Vector).
The freelist is simply a `std::queue` of unused PRFs that can be
popped and assigned to an instruction.  Once a PRF is popped from the
freelist, the `map_table_` is updated to indicate the current ARF's
PRF to be used.

```
   // pseudo code
   auto arf = inst->getDestARF()
   auto new_prf = reg_file_components_[reg_file].freelist.pop()
   auto old_prf = map_table_[arf]
   map_table_[arf] = new_prf
   inst->setDestPRF(new_prf, old_ptf)
```

The `old_prf`, however, might still be in use by instructions older
than the current instruction being renamed.  The `old_prf` is stored
in the instruction to put back on the freelist once the instruction
sucessfully retires.

===== Reclaiming PRFs

As instructions are renamed, the freelist queue will drain.
Eventually it will run of out PRFs and Rename will stall.

PRFs are reclaimed and pushed onto the freelist in one of two ways:

- Instructions that retire are sent back to Rename to reclaim the old
  PRF (see `old_prf` above)
- The pipeline experiences a flush, in which the map table and the
  free list must be restored/rebuilt.

As Retire retires instructions, it groups them into an `InstGroup` and
sends the group to Rename via Rename's port `in_rename_retire_ack_`.
Rename will walk the retiring instruction _in order_ (oldest to
newest) and collect `old_prf` values.

==== Move Elimination

The Rename model supports a concept called "move elimination."  This
pertains to those RISC-V instructions that simply move a register's
value from one register to another without changing the value.  As an
optimization, this can be handled in Rename by having Rename map
multiple ARFs to the same PRF.

Take these `mv` instructions:

```
mv x2, x1
mv x3, x1
```

Without move elimination, Rename would assign new PRFs to both `mv`
operations and send the instruction to the middle machine to be "executed."

```
# x55 <- map_table_[x1]

# map_table_[x2] = x65
mv x65, x55

# map_table_[x3] = x66
mv x66, x55
```

This is inefficient as two PRFs are now consumed representing the same
contents as `x1 -> x55`.  In addition, these `mv` instructions are
consuming middle machine resources and power.

With move elimination, Rename can identify this inefficiency and just update the mapping:

```
# x55 <- map_table_[x1]

# map_table_[x2] = x55
mv --, x55  # eliminated!

# map_table_[x3] = x55
mv --, x55  # eliminated!
```

The `mv` is "eliminated" because Rename essentially executed it.
Rename now marks the `mv` as "done" and the instruction is dispatched
to the Retire block only.

To facilitate the move elimination, Rename must keep track of the
number of times `x55` in the above example is referenced.  This is
done using the member variable `reference_counter` found in the
`RegFileComponents` data structure.

When newer instructions overwrite the map table for `x2` and `x3`,
Rename cannot push `x55` back onto the freelist until its reference
count reaches 0.
